## Simple Java based game

## Features

- reading from a file
- handling various exceptions
- working with Hashsets and ArrayLists
- using multiline Strings to draw the Hangmen stages

## Installation

This project uses Java, so it requires [OpenJDK 23](https://www.oracle.com/de/java/technologies/downloads/) (Download from Oracle)  to run and a valid RunTimeEnvironment, for example [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/idea/download/?section=windows).

Install the JDK and RunTimeEnvironment and run following command.

```sh
java -version
```

If that does not work, it might be needed to set up Environment Variables.

## Usages
1. Open your terminal and go to your project folder

```sh
cd path/project
```

2. Compile the file
```sh
javac Hangmen.java
```
3. Run the compiled file with valid parameters (text file)

java Hangmen validFile.txt
```
